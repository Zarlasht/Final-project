The fresh, zingy eggless lemon curd was amazing, allowing us to enjoy it for longer which is what we wanted (although not much left now). The gold details, figs, and blueberries were stunning, and it stayed gorgeous the whole time. The thoughtful packaging and allergens note were much appreciated. Was so impressed at my first order with Little Joy and will be ordering again very soon! You really made my vision come to life, even with such short notice!"

We didn't even know where to start because the cake is so pretty! Taste of the cake is as awesome as it looks! For me is the icing, it's smooth and the sweetness is not overpowering! With the blend of the summer fruit to balance the whole cake it's really smart, we just can't stop eating! Thank you for putting your heart and soul in baking the cake for our little girl ❤"
